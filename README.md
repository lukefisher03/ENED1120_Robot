# ENED1120_Robot
Pybricks code for ENED1120 robot project at the university of cincinnati

# Results
Our robot completed all 4 tasks nearly perfectly. The only points deducted came from the fact that our task 3 and 4 weren't one continuous operation.
Due to scoring high in the initial stage of the demo, our team advanced to the final demo. However, we had not written any code for the demo. Thus I ended
up writing code on the fly in the 9 minutes given to us. Our robot was able to move to the correct destination and pick up the box. However, we did not
earn any additional points after this.
